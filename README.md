small product App 

To Run the Project locally you should run server & client together by `npm run start` from the project root,
 Then run the front end code by run `cd client && npm run start` from client root. 
 
you can also build the front end on the server port by run `cd client && npm run build`
then run the server only by `npm run start` and every thing will be ok. ISA.

Thanks.
